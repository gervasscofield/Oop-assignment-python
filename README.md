# 🧠 OOP Assignment – Python

This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates two major OOP concepts:

## 📌 File: `oop_assignment.py`

### 🏗️ Part 1: Custom Class with Inheritance
- **Class:** `Superhero`
- **Subclass:** `FlyingSuperhero` (inherits from `Superhero`)
- **Concepts Used:** Attributes, Methods, Constructors (`__init__`), and Inheritance.
- **What it does:** Each superhero has powers, strength, and some can fly!

### 🎭 Part 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- **Classes:** `Vehicle` (base class), with `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` as subclasses.
- **Method:** `.move()` behaves differently in each subclass.
- **What it shows:** Polymorphism—same method name, different behavior.

## ▶️ How to Run
Make sure Python is installed, then run the file using:

```bash
python oop_assignment.py
## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Class and Object creation
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding
- Polymorphism
